### Summary:

A :globe_with_meridians: browser extension for testing and developing responsive websites in windows that simulate Safari windows on iOS.

---

### Story
Sizesable was made from a responsive website project wich was in need for a technique to have several windows open at specific windows sizes. This specific windows sizes were the sizes of all most recent iOS devices screen sizes. From there, it was discovered that this is a need for web designers/developers in order to simplify their work.

The Sizesable project and Safari's Sizesable Extension v1.0 was created by Christopher Gonzalez D.K.A. [@gchriswill](https://twitter.com/gchriswill)
