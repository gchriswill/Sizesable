### Summary:

:globe_with_meridians: A Safari browser extension for testing and developing responsive layouts that simulate the plethera of iOS screen sizes.

---

### Story
Sizesable was created due to the developer's need while working on a responsive website project that required several windows open with specific windows sizes. Sizesable's purpose is to allow the display of a multitude of popular iOS device screen sizes, each within their own, indiviual window. It is believed that this is a need for web designers/developers in order to simplify their work.

The Sizesable project and Safari's Sizesable Extension v1.0 was created by Christopher Gonzalez D.K.A. [@gchriswill](https://twitter.com/gchriswill)
